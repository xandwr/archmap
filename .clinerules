# AI Agent Instructions

You have access to the `archmap` CLI tool in this repository. **Use it proactively** to understand the codebase before making changes.

## Quick Start

```bash
archmap              # Analyze current directory architecture
archmap analyze .    # Same as above, explicit
archmap ai .         # AI-optimized output (compact, structured for LLM consumption)
archmap impact src/foo.rs  # See what's affected if you change a file
```

## When to Use

- **Before refactoring**: Run `archmap analyze` to understand module coupling and dependencies
- **Before editing a file**: Run `archmap impact <file>` to see blast radius
- **When exploring**: Run `archmap ai` for a structured overview optimized for your context window

## All Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `archmap analyze [path]` | Full architectural analysis with coupling metrics |
| `archmap ai [path]` | Compact AI-friendly output |
| `archmap impact <file>` | Change impact analysis for a specific file |
| `archmap snapshot` | Save current architecture state |
| `archmap diff` | Compare against a saved snapshot |
| `archmap graph` | Interactive visualization |
| `archmap init` | Generate `.archmap.toml` config |

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Starting a refactoring task
archmap analyze .           # Understand current structure
archmap impact src/cli.rs   # Check what depends on the file you're changing
# ... make changes ...
archmap analyze .           # Verify you didn't introduce coupling issues
```

**This tool is installed and ready to use. No setup required.**
